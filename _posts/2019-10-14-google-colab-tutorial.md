### Google Colab
###### Author: Sanjiv Soni
---------------------------------------------------
Google Colab provides a cloud based workspace just like Jupiter Notebooks for performing analysis, munging data and creating visualisations and a lot more.

For those of you who are are not familiar with python Notebooks, a notebook is a file/document where you can write code and also write descriptive text explaining your analysis. It offers a reproducible environment. If you create a notebook with some blocks of code and write a few descriptions, others can continue or collaborate with you on the same notebook, given its readable and understandable.

If some of you and are unable to setup Jupiter notebooks on their machines, google Colab can be an alternative. It works with the standard google suite, you can load data from google drive and save colab notebooks into your drives too. Theres absolutely zero setup and you can create colab notebooks right from your browser and start exploring it right now.

PS. Pro Tip : Google Colab even offers free GPU computation.
