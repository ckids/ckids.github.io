The USC Center for Knowledge-Powered Interdisciplinary Data Science (CKIDS) was established in Spring 2019 as a campus-wide organized research unit that serves as a nexus for data science collaborations across schools and departments in the university.

CKIDS puts forward a unique vision for data science at USC focused on incorporating diverse disciplinary knowledge into data-driven inquiry.  In this view, data science connects advanced computer science and informatics research together with rich knowledge about the context and use of the data that comes from a particular expertise area or discipline.

We welcome faculty, students, researchers, and everyone in the Trojan family to participate in CKIDS.  Please signup for our mailing list or contact us with any questions!
